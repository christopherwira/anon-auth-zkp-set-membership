    "- `SSTORE`: writing operation that costs 20,000 gas or 2,900 gas (it is cheaper to rewrite existing variable)\n",

    "    - 2 `SLOAD` operations which cost 4,200 gas, and\n",

    "    - 1 `SLOAD` operation which costs 2,100 gas, and\n",

    "    - 1 `SLOAD` operation which costs 2,100 gas.\n",
