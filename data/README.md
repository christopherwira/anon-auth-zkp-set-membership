# Overview

Here in this directory, we provide the following files:

- Jupyter Notebook files that provide all the calculations to create the experiment result
- CSV files that contain raw data which we manually gather using Remix IDE

At the end of the notebook, we provided the experiment results which ended up on our paper.

## Dependencies

This experiment requires the reader to set up a working Python environment with a Jupyter Notebook installed.

We recommend the user to utilize [**Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/) to create the required environment.

After cloning the main repository, please open the `data` directory and run the command:

```
jupyter notebook
```

on the terminal to run the Jupyter Notebook server.

Open the `.ipynb` file using the Jupyter Notebook browser and follow the instructions inside the notebook.
